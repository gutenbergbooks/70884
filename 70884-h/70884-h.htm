<div class="chapter">
<h4 class="h4head">TRISTAN BERNARD.</h4>

<p>Tristan Bernard stands in much the same relation
to contemporary French drama as George Cohan
does to that of our own country: in his comedies
the most amusing types of the society of the day
are set forth with a good-humor and freshness
which gives them an individual charm all their own.
Many of his numerous plays are broad farces, but
there is a philosophical strain running throughout
which raises them out of the realm of the purely
theatrical. In “On nait esclave” (“Born Slaves”)
and “Le Petit Café” (“The Little Café”), for
example, we find a serious comment on life; this,
however, never interferes with the joyous course of
the comedy, but rather forms a background.</p>

<p>One of Bernard’s earliest plays was “L’Anglais
tel qu’on le parle,” which is here (necessarily, on
account of the fact that English is used in the
original text as a foreign language) adapted, for
the first time in English. The cleverness of the
plot, the character of the interpreter, the brightness
of the dialogue, have caused the little farce to be
retained in the repertory of the Comédie Française,
where it is performed many times every year, with
ever-increasing popularity.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Chanoine-Malherbe and Séraphine should speak
good French, or at least some approximation which
shall sound fluent and easy to the audience.
Amateurs are urged not to over-act: this play is
one which can easily be over-accentuated. Percy,
in particular, should behave throughout as a very
quiet and phlegmatic person.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">FRENCH WITHOUT A MASTER</h3>

<hr class="short">

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>:—<i>A small office in a hotel. There is a large
door center, giving upon the hallway. Down-stage
and up-stage to the right are doors;
similar doors on the left. Half-way down-stage
on the left is the</i> <span class="smcap">Cashier’s</span> <i>desk, with
inkstands and register. On the walls are
posters and train schedules. Half-way down-stage
and a little to left of center is a table
covered with magazines, etc., and a telephone.
As the curtain rises, the</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span> <i>is seen seated
on a small stool just below the</i> <span class="smcap">Cashier’s</span> <i>desk.
A moment later, enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gerald</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Séraphine</span>,
<i>each with a valise.</i> <span class="smcap">Séraphine</span> <i>is typically
French and wears stylish clothes of the latest
cut</i>; <span class="smcap">Gerald</span> <i>is equally well dressed. He goes
to the</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span>, <i>lays down his valise, takes that
of</i> <span class="smcap">Séraphine</span> <i>and places it beside his own</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> We’d like two rooms, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porter.</span> One moment, sir; I’ll call the cashier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Is there a telegraph office around here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porter.</span> Yes, sir, it’s just around the corner.
Shall I take your message, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> No, I’ll take it myself.</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span> <i>goes out</i>.)<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> Mon chéri, je voudrais une chambre
exposée au soleil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Oui, oui, ma chère.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> Je suis très lasse. Comment dit-on? Tired?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Oui—yes. Dearest, you must learn to
speak English all the time; we don’t want people
to stare at us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> Oh, but I do not know well how the
English speaks itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Nonsense, you’re getting along
splendidly.</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cashier</span>, <i>up-stage right</i>.)<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> How do you do? You’d like a room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Two, if you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> We have two nice rooms on the second
floor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> That’s capital!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> (<i>Turning the register toward</i> <span class="smcap">Gerald</span>
<i>and handing him a pen</i>) Just sign here, please.
That’s right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> (<i>Looking over</i> <span class="smcap">Gerald’s</span> <i>shoulder</i>)
Ah, tu es—!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> Would you mind waiting a moment?
I’ll have the rooms ready presently. (<i>She goes out,
up-stage, right.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> Ah, Mister Parkinson! Mrs.
Parkinson! Que c’est drôle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Certainly; I couldn’t give our real
names. It would be nice to put down “Mr. Gerald
Forsyth and Mlle. Séraphine Chanoine-Malherbe”—especially
as you told me yourself that your
father knew of this hotel, and might come here
and find us—nous surprendre ici.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> It is a wicked thing, this that we
have done. I know too, my father, he remember
this hotel, well. He know the name: Hotel Gainsborough:
he has been here before. Ecoute-moi
bien—listen me—<i>to</i> me, dear. I think I have seen
his gray hat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> But there are hundreds of gray hats in
London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> But I am sure I have seen the—the—paternal
hat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Nonsense, my dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> Ah, mon chéri!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Don’t say “Mon chéri!”—say “My
dear.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> My dear! Oh, I wish I were safely
married to you. Oh, how wicked to run away like
this!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> But we had to! It was the only way to
make him consent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> But if your—patron? Employer?
would give you an interest in the business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> Then Papa would have let me be
married with—<i>to</i> you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Yes, dear, I know. My employer, however,
doesn’t see it in that light. Wait three months,
he says, and then we’ll see. Well, if your Papa
refused, we had to do this. And here we are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> You are right, dear; you always
are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> And our elopement is at the expense of
the company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> Bad, bad boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> And now I must leave you for a few
minutes. I must send a telegram to the chief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> And you will leave me all alone?
What if I would wish for anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Well, you can speak English.</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Cashier</span>.)<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> No, no—or only with those who
also speak the French. I’m so afraid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> But, there must be an interpreter here—(<i>To
the</i> <span class="smcap">Cashier</span>) Isn’t there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> Of course. He should be here in a
moment. Meantime, the rooms are ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Séraphine</span>) I’ll take you up,
and then run to the office.</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>They go out, up-stage right.</i>)<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> (<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span>, <i>who enters, center</i>)
Why hasn’t our interpreter come yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porter.</span> Oh, Graham? He’s sick, but he’s sent
another fellow in his place. He’s out in the hall
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> Tell him to come in. (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span>
<i>goes out at the back, and beckons to someone in the
hall. A moment later enter</i> <span class="smcap">Percy</span>, <i>a respectable
tramp. His clothes are well-worn, but not ragged,
and they fit him rather tightly,—his trousers also are
too short. He has not had a shave for some time.
He tips his hat—an old “derby”—timidly, then
walks slowly to the center of the stage, looking
about uneasily. The</i> <span class="smcap">Cashier</span> <i>addresses him somewhat
sharply</i>) So you have come to take Mr.
Graham’s place? (<span class="smcap">Percy</span> <i>nods</i>) You have been
told the conditions, I believe; six shillings a day.
Now understand, we want a good interpreter,
serious and attentive to business. All you have to
do is wait here until any foreigners come, and then
help them. Understand? (<span class="smcap">Percy</span> <i>again nods</i>)
Good. (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Cashier</span> <i>goes out, up-stage left</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> (<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span>, <i>after a short pause</i>)
Many foreigners come here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porter.</span> Oh, I don’t know! Few French now
and then; depends on the season.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> (<i>A little disturbed</i>) Oh—many foreigners
just now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porter.</span> Not so many.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> (<i>A little more at ease</i>) Do you think
any’ll come to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porter.</span> Can’t say—Here, take your cap. (<i>He
hands</i> <span class="smcap">Percy</span> <i>a cap with the words “INTERPRÈTE”
written on the front. The</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span> <i>then
goes out at the back</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> (<i>Hat in hand, as he reads the inscription</i>)
In-ter-preet. (<i>Puts on the cap</i>) Good!
Hope them blarsted frog-eaters keep away. Don’t
know a single word of French, er German, er
I-talian, er Spanish, er any of them dialects. Good
thing for an interpreter! But I’m no millionaire,
and them six shillin’s! Hm! But I mightily fear
conversation may languish if I meet any o’ them
foreigners.</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>Re-enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Cashier</span>.)<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> I forgot to ask you something a
moment ago: you know there are a great many
interpreters who know all the languages of Europe
and don’t know their mother tongue. You speak
English well, don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Perfectly, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> Good. I wanted to be quite sure, you
know. You didn’t speak when I was talking to
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Ye can rest quiet on that point, Ma’am.
I speaks English admi-rably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> We haven’t many French people at
this season. (<i>The telephone bell rings. The</i>
<span class="smcap">Cashier</span> <i>runs to the table, center, and takes off the
receiver. A moment later she lays it on the table</i>)
It’s from Paris. (<span class="smcap">Percy</span>, <i>who is comfortably leaning
against the</i> <span class="smcap">Cashier’s</span> <i>desk, does not move a
hair. The</i> <span class="smcap">Cashier</span> <i>goes to him</i>) Someone’s telephoning
from Paris. It’s in French! Are you
deaf? Go to the telephone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> (<i>Advancing slowly to the table, and
picking up the receiver</i>) Hello? (<i>Lays the receiver
down, and faces the audience in despair</i>)
That’s it; they’re French. (<i>Again listening, and
again laying down the receiver</i>) Don’t understand
a word! (<i>Speaking into the transmitter</i>)
Oui, oui, oui. (<i>He is at his wits’ end</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> What do they say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> What do they say? Oh, nothing very
important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> People don’t telephone from Paris to
say nothing very important!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> (<i>Again speaking into the telephone</i>)
Oui, oui.—Yes, they’re French, no doubt about it.
They—they want some rooms, and so I said “Oui,
oui.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> Well, is that all they say? When?
How much do they want to pay? Ask them, ask
them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> (<i>Hesitating</i>) They want—four rooms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> When?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> For—er—next Thursday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> What kind of rooms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> On the second floor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> Tell them we have only two on that
floor at present, but another will be vacant the day
they arrive—on the fifteenth. Or else we could let
them have two first-rate rooms on the third floor,
if they like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Do you want me to tell them that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> Yes, and hurry. (<span class="smcap">Percy</span> <i>hesitates</i>)
What are you waiting for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> (<i>Dumbfounded</i>) Eh?—er—(<i>Listening
at the telephone</i>) Sonfrancaispollyvoogrllgon—Oh!
(<i>He hangs up the receiver</i>) Whew, that’s
over with, thank Heaven!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> They must be rich—You know it costs
ten shillings every three minutes to telephone from
Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Ten bob for three minutes? What’s
that come to by the hour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> Ten pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Ten—?!</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe</span>, <i>center</i>.)<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> C’est ici l’Hôtel Gainsborough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Oui, oui. (<i>He slowly turns round his
hat, hiding the word INTERPRÈTE</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> Ya-t-il ici un jeune
monsieur et une jeune demoiselle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Oui, oui. (<i>He retreats toward the lower
left door, and disappears</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> Qu’est-ce qu’il y a? Où
est l’interprète?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> What do you wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> Bonjour, Madame M.
Forsyth, est-il ici?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> Forsyth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> Oui, Forsyth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> No, there’s no one registered here with
that name. No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> Voyons, un jeune
homme et une jeune demoiselle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> I can’t understand a word you are
saying. Interpreter! (<i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span>) Have
you seen the interpreter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porter.</span> He was here a moment ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> (<i>Taking a pocket-dictionary
from his valise</i>) Commissaire, police—here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porter.</span> Wot’s ’e saying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> I think he wants to see a police officer.
(<i>Pointing</i>) Just around the corner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> Non,—here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> He wants to see the officer here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> Oui, oui—here. (<i>Gives
the</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span> <i>a coin</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porter.</span> Thank you, sir. (<i>Aside</i>) Ten bob!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span>) Run around to the
station and get an officer—then the Frenchman can
tell him what he wants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> Oui, oui.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> These Frenchmen! How did he get
the thief’s picture?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> I forgot to tell you, but the man who
stole the pocket-book was an old acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> What name? Ask him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> The name? Hm—Why his name <span class="lock">is—er—Gaston——</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Gás-ton. (<i>Emphasis on the first syllable</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Very good. I’ll start an investigation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Yes, you’d better go at once. Besides,

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> (<i>Looking at his dictionary</i>)
Ig-no-rant In-ter-pre-ter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> He means “ignorant.” You are an
ignorant interpreter! But I <span class="lock">thought——</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> No, no, no—Ig-no-rant in French means—Oh,
if you only knew what that meant!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chanoine-Malherbe.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Cashier</span> <i>as he goes

<p><span class="smcap">Cashier.</span> He is disturbed, isn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Not at all, he’s charmed. That’s the way

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> (<i>Forgetting about his throat</i>) Oh, you

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> (<i>Coughs</i>) Not at all well. It’s a little
better. Don’t mention it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> Ya-t-il un bureau de télégraphes

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> What’s the good of talking French when
you can speak English so well? That’s no way to
learn a language.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Séraphine.</span> I cannot speak well the English.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
